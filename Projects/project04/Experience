I tried Meditating for the first time when I was seventeen. So the technique of meditation I follow is to basically give a thought that a divine light exists within, and the source of that light is pulling you towards it.T he idea is to meditate i.e bring your attention to the heart. Very magically, this thought very soon turns into an amazing feeling.

The first time I meditated, It wasn’t easy. And, I didn’t even know I was doing it right.

 I close my eyes, and meditate on the Heart, I know that I am connecting to a home, not so far away, that is sending me waves of love to let me know, that no matter wherever I go, my existence is centred around it.

And when I open my eyes, I know that all the love I felt within, wasn’t a dream. It was for real.

I am a terrible meditator. I am working on it though. I now feel that there is something profound for me to learn from it. This is very new though. Before it seemed like silly to me almost. Clearing your mind like that and somehow thinking without thinking but I recently experienced what is called a simple partial or focal aware siezure and I understand it perfectly now. It seems exactly like what you are trying to do with Zen meditation by being aware without any thought and the whole being at one with nothingess thing. I wish I had a better answer than this. Just know that it is really a very difficult thing to get good at for most people, and it can frustrate you. Do you know how to get to Carnegie Hall? Practice my friend. : )

It was like drowning (and there is a reason for it).

My martial art sensei had us lie down amd breath in by count of 10 and breath out counting 10 (less for smaller people. I count up to 8 only).

The lack of oxygen seems to trigger a trauma I had at age of 18 which was drowning by the sea. So what I experience was that fear. I felt that I had fallen out of my body, into the ground and was struggling to resurface.

But this time, I was in control (of the breathe) and I was able to float between the realm of the dead and living until the end of the meditation session 15 minutes later. It was trully a remarkable feeling.

At the very beginning of your meditation practice, have a gentle dialogue with your mind. Sit down quietly and ask yourself, “What do I want?” You will learn many things when you enter into this kind of self-dialogue. You will come in contact with your inner states. You will learn about the subtle aspects of your mind, your own conscience—and you will see that you are training yourself in the process.

Every time you sit to meditate, first remember the spiritual power of your practice. Recall the strength of the meditative traditions that inspire you. Examine yourself sincerely and ask yourself if you want to meditate, to explore, to know yourself, and to form new habits of living. Then, inspect within to see what is good and what is not good for your practice. Ask yourself if the thought that is coming to you is helpful for your meditation or not. In this way, your meditation will be guided by the higher forces within you—and not led off into fantasies and wish-fulfillments.
